# Punch It Up

Goal: sharpen how a concept is framed for pitches, memos, intros, and cold opens.

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user to paste current framing/copy → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
4. **Auto-load secondary skills** (see section below)

## Auto-Load Secondary Skills (MANDATORY)

After receiving the user's current framing/copy, scan for keywords and **use the Skill tool** to load relevant secondary skills **before** beginning the punch-it-up flow.

**Keyword triggers → Skills to load**:
- "ICP", "customer", "pain", "buyer", "problem" → `skills/secondary/problem-and-customer-pain`
- "fundraise", "investor", "deck", "pitch", "raise" → `skills/secondary/fundraising-narrative-and-arc`
- "traction", "metrics", "KPIs", "milestones", "growth" → `skills/secondary/traction-metrics-and-milestones`
- "market", "TAM", "SAM", "SOM", "market size" → `skills/secondary/tam-sam-som-triangulation`
- "GTM", "go-to-market", "sales", "pipeline" → `skills/secondary/growth-motion-and-sales-design`
- "pricing", "packaging", "price", "tiers" → `skills/secondary/pricing-and-packaging`
- "unit economics", "CAC", "LTV", "gross margin" → `skills/secondary/unit-economics-and-sensitivity`
- "competitors", "competitive", "positioning" → `skills/secondary/competition-and-positioning`
- "moat", "defensibility", "barriers" → `skills/secondary/defensibility-and-barriers`

**Instructions**:
1. Use the **Skill tool** to load each matched skill
2. Read and absorb the Core Questions and Artifacts from each loaded skill
3. Use insights from loaded skills to inform before/after rewrites and proof points
4. Proceed with Turn structure below

## Turn structure
1) **Target** — audience + outcome (what do you want them to do/feel?)
2) **Crux** — the non‑obvious advantage in one line; what's *different* or *inevitable*
3) **Material** — grab the current lines (tagline, cold open, 3 bullets, proof)
4) **Angles** — 3 frames (pain math, inevitability/timing, analogy/contrast). **Inform with loaded secondary skills.**
5) **Rewrite** — produce **before/after** pairs; keep receipts for claims. **Use proof points from loaded secondary skills.**
6) **Tighten** — verbs > nouns, concrete > abstract, outcomes > features
7) **Cadence** — short‑long‑short rhythm; one memorable line; optional kicker

## Secondary skills to reference (when relevant)
- `problem-and-customer-pain` — if refining pain framing
- `fundraising-narrative-and-arc` — if this is for deck/pitch
- `traction-metrics-and-milestones` — if proof points need sharpening

## What "compelling" looks like
- **Specific** (numbers, nouns): "Cut outage truck rolls 37%" > "improves reliability."
- **Contrast** (before→after; switch cost vs payoff).
- **Credibility** (logos, metrics, standards) with minimal brag.
- **Story energy** (stakes, tension, resolve) without fluff.

## What is **not** compelling
- Buzzword salad; "AI‑powered platform" with no outcome.
- Weasel words: "kind of, robust, seamless, innovative."
- Claims with no **receipts** (links, metrics, user quotes).

## Micro‑commands
- `before` — show the current phrasing pulled from notes
- `after` — generate alt takes (3 options: direct, narrative, numbers‑first)
- `harder` — increase contrast/edge and commit to a stance
- `softer` — reduce hype; keep credibility tone
- `strip` — remove filler, adverbs, and stacked adjectives
- `angles` — list 5 fresh framings (pain, timing, analogy, wedge, inevitability)
- `anchor:<comp>` — frame via comparison/foil (e.g., `anchor:Snowflake for batteries`)
- `no-fluff` — rewrite in 2 lines max; nouns, numbers, verbs only
- `demo` — propose a one‑minute live demo script (beats only)
