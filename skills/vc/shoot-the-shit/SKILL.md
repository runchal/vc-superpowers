# Shoot The Shit (STS)

Free‑flow conversation to explore, pressure‑test, and reframe—**ideas over artifacts**.

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user to paste their thoughts/notes → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
4. **Auto-load secondary skills** (see section below)

## Auto-Load Secondary Skills (MANDATORY)

After receiving the user's thoughts/notes, scan for keywords and **use the Skill tool** to load relevant secondary skills **before** beginning the exploration.

**Keyword triggers → Skills to load**:
- "ICP", "customer", "pain", "buyer", "problem" → `skills/secondary/problem-and-customer-pain`
- "market", "TAM", "SAM", "SOM", "market size" → `skills/secondary/tam-sam-som-triangulation`
- "GTM", "go-to-market", "sales", "pipeline", "funnel" → `skills/secondary/growth-motion-and-sales-design`
- "competitors", "competitive", "positioning" → `skills/secondary/competition-and-positioning`
- "moat", "defensibility", "barriers" → `skills/secondary/defensibility-and-barriers`
- "fundraise", "investor", "deck", "pitch", "raise" → `skills/secondary/fundraising-narrative-and-arc`
- "traction", "metrics", "KPIs", "milestones", "growth" → `skills/secondary/traction-metrics-and-milestones`
- "pricing", "packaging", "price", "tiers", "discount" → `skills/secondary/pricing-and-packaging`
- "unit economics", "CAC", "LTV", "gross margin", "payback" → `skills/secondary/unit-economics-and-sensitivity`

**Instructions**:
1. Use the **Skill tool** to load each matched skill
2. Read and absorb the Core Questions and Artifacts from each loaded skill
3. Synthesize questions across all loaded skills + the STS flow
4. Proceed with Turn structure below

## Turn structure
1) **Hook** — one‑line crux.
2) **Probe** — 2–3 short follow‑ups across buyer / product / market. **Include questions from loaded secondary skills.**
3) **Branch** — create **tiles** for emergent threads.
4) **Deep‑dive** — on "go deeper," take that tile two levels down.
5) **Surface** — optional 3‑bullet Highlights on request.

## Secondary skills to reference (when relevant)
- `problem-and-customer-pain` — if discussing ICP or pain points
- `tam-sam-som-triangulation` — if market sizing questions emerge
- `growth-motion-and-sales-design` — if GTM motion comes up
- `competition-and-positioning` — if competitive landscape is discussed
- `defensibility-and-barriers` — if moat/barriers emerge

## Micro‑commands
- `tile:<name>` — create/focus a tile (e.g., `tile:operator angels`)
- `park:<name>` — move tile to Parking‑lot
- `switch:<name>` — change focus tile
- `converge` — compress to **Takeaways + Next micro‑questions**
- `spicy` — push on uncomfortable assumptions for one turn

**Guardrails:** no solutioning unless invited; cite facts; propose 60‑sec napkin math when $$ matters.

## MANDATORY Output

**Format**:
```markdown
