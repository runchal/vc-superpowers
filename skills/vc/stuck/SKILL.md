# Stuck → Unblocked

Coaching via questions; momentum over perfection.

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user to describe stuck point → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
4. **Auto-load secondary skills** (see section below)

## Auto-Load Secondary Skills (MANDATORY)

After receiving the user's stuck point description, scan for keywords and **use the Skill tool** to load relevant secondary skills **before** beginning the unblocker flow. The goal is to load any skill that might help overcome the specific friction point.

**Keyword triggers → Skills to load**:
- "ICP", "customer", "pain", "buyer", "problem" → `skills/secondary/problem-and-customer-pain`
- "market", "TAM", "SAM", "SOM", "market size" → `skills/secondary/tam-sam-som-triangulation`
- "fundraise", "investor", "deck", "pitch", "raise" → `skills/secondary/fundraising-narrative-and-arc`
- "traction", "metrics", "KPIs", "milestones", "growth" → `skills/secondary/traction-metrics-and-milestones`
- "GTM", "go-to-market", "sales", "pipeline", "funnel" → `skills/secondary/growth-motion-and-sales-design`
- "pricing", "packaging", "price", "tiers" → `skills/secondary/pricing-and-packaging`
- "unit economics", "CAC", "LTV", "gross margin" → `skills/secondary/unit-economics-and-sensitivity`
- "competitors", "competitive", "positioning" → `skills/secondary/competition-and-positioning`
- "moat", "defensibility", "barriers" → `skills/secondary/defensibility-and-barriers`
- "regulatory", "compliance", "certification" → `skills/secondary/regulatory-and-certification-deeptech`
- "diligence", "data room", "DD" → `skills/secondary/diligence-data-room-checklist`
- "ready", "readiness", "audit" → `skills/secondary/investment-readiness-audit`

**Instructions**:
1. Use the **Skill tool** to load each matched skill
2. Read and absorb the Core Questions and Artifacts from each loaded skill
3. Identify if the loaded skill provides frameworks to overcome the stuck point
4. Proceed with Turn structure below

## Turn structure
1) **Name it** — one‑line stuck point.
2) **Why now** — what constraint or fear makes this sticky? **Use frameworks from loaded secondary skills to diagnose.**
3) **Shrink it** — define a 15‑minute version of progress. **Reference specific actions from loaded secondary skills.**
4) **Design friction** — two obstacles; add an IF‑THEN for each.
5) **Start line** — pick a timestamp; quick "after" check‑in.

## Micro‑commands
- `momentum` — bias toward tiny, immediate actions
- `decision` — bias toward choosing among options
- `creative` — bias toward idea-generation frames

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/unblocker-[topic].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Unblocker: [Topic]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Stuck point**: [One-line description]

## Why This Is Sticky
**Constraint or fear**: [What makes this sticky right now?]

## 15-Minute Version of Progress
[What does a tiny win look like? What's the smallest possible progress?]

## Obstacles + IF-THEN Plans
### Obstacle 1: [Name]
**IF** [trigger condition]
**THEN** [specific action]

### Obstacle 2: [Name]
**IF** [trigger condition]
**THEN** [specific action]

## 3-Step Micro-Plan
1. **[Action 1]** — [When: timestamp] — [Duration: e.g., 15 min]
2. **[Action 2]** — [When: timestamp] — [Duration: e.g., 15 min]
3. **[Action 3]** — [When: timestamp] — [Duration: e.g., 15 min]

## After Check-In
**Scheduled for**: [Timestamp]
**What to assess**: [What question to ask yourself?]

## Calendar-Friendly Wording
📅 [Action 1]: [Time block description]
📅 [Action 2]: [Time block description]
📅 [Action 3]: [Time block description]
```

**End-of-session**: Log summary in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
