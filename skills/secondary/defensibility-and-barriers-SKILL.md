# Defensibility & Barriers

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for moat/defensibility data (data advantages, workflow lock-in, IP, distribution) → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Core Questions
- Source of moat: data advantage, workflow lock‑in, standards, distribution, brand.
- Time to build; leading indicators; maintenance cost.
- Copycat risk and attacker’s required budget/talent/time.

## Quick Reference
- Show a timeline with compounding effects and proof milestones.

## Artifacts
- Moat timeline; barrier table (what it blocks, how measured).

## Common Mistakes
- Calling "first‑mover" or "IP filed" a moat without usage/data scale.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/defensibility-and-barriers-[company].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Defensibility & Barriers: [Company Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Input Data
[Paste of user's moat/defensibility data from context.md]

## Moat Source Analysis

### Primary Moat(s)
Select and detail the primary source(s) of defensibility:

**[ ] Data Advantage**
- **What data**: [Type of proprietary data]
- **Volume**: [Current scale: X records, Y deployments, Z hours]
- **Uniqueness**: [Why competitors can't replicate]
- **Compounding**: [How it improves with scale]

**[ ] Workflow Lock-In**
- **Integration points**: [Where we embed in their workflow]
- **Switching cost**: [Time/money to migrate out]
- **Habit formation**: [Daily/weekly/monthly touchpoints]

**[ ] Standards/Protocols**
- **Standard**: [Name of standard/protocol]
- **Adoption**: [Who else uses it, market share]
- **Control**: [Our role in standard body/governance]

**[ ] Distribution/Channel**
- **Exclusive relationships**: [Partners who can't easily switch]
- **Network density**: [Geographic/vertical coverage]
- **Brand/certification**: [What we're known for]

**[ ] Brand/Category**
- **Category we define**: [Category name]
- **Mind share**: [Search volume, brand mentions]
- **Switching perception**: [What customers lose by leaving]

### Moat Timeline (Compounding Effects)

| Quarter | Milestone/Metric | Compounding Effect | Proof |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Q1 | [e.g., 10 deployments] | [e.g., Initial dataset for ML training] | [Source] |
| Q2 | [e.g., 50 deployments] | [e.g., Model accuracy +15%] | [Source] |
| Q3 | [e.g., 150 deployments] | [e.g., New use cases enabled] | [Source] |
| Q4 | [e.g., 500 deployments] | [e.g., Market-leading dataset] | [Source] |

**Leading indicators** (what to track):
1. [Metric 1]: [Target value by quarter]
2. [Metric 2]: [Target value by quarter]
3. [Metric 3]: [Target value by quarter]

## Barrier Analysis

### Time to Build
**For us to reach current position**: [X] months
- [Component 1]: [Time]
- [Component 2]: [Time]
- [Component 3]: [Time]

**For competitor to replicate**: [Y] months
- [Component 1]: [Time]
- [Component 2]: [Time]
- [Component 3]: [Time]

### Maintenance Cost
**Ongoing investment to maintain moat**: $[amount]/year or [X] FTEs
- [Activity 1]: [Cost/effort]
- [Activity 2]: [Cost/effort]
- [Activity 3]: [Cost/effort]

## Copycat Risk Assessment

### Attacker Profile
**Budget required**: $[X]M
**Talent required**: [# and type of people, specializations]
**Time required**: [X] months
**Success probability**: [Low/Medium/High] ([rationale])

### What Blocks Them

| Barrier | What It Blocks | How Measured | Current Status |
|---------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| [e.g., Dataset] | [e.g., Model accuracy] | [e.g., # records] | [e.g., 500K records] |
| [e.g., Certifications] | [e.g., Market access] | [e.g., UL/CE/FCC] | [e.g., UL done, CE in progress] |
| [e.g., Channel relationships] | [e.g., Distribution reach] | [e.g., # installers trained] | [e.g., 50 certified installers] |
| [e.g., Customer integrations] | [e.g., Switching cost] | [e.g., # API endpoints used] | [e.g., Avg 12 integrations/customer] |

## Moat Maintenance Plan

**Quarterly investments**:
1. **[Activity 1]**: $[amount] → [Expected compounding effect]
2. **[Activity 2]**: $[amount] → [Expected compounding effect]
3. **[Activity 3]**: $[amount] → [Expected compounding effect]

**Risks to moat**:
1. [Risk 1]: [Mitigation plan]
2. [Risk 2]: [Mitigation plan]
3. [Risk 3]: [Mitigation plan]

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes Check
- [ ] "First-mover" not used as sole moat claim
- [ ] "IP filed" backed by usage/data scale or enforcement budget
- [ ] Compounding effects shown with actual metrics over time
- [ ] Copycat risk assessed with realistic budget/time/talent requirements
- [ ] Leading indicators defined to track moat strength
