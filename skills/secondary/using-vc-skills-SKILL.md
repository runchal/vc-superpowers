# Using VC Skills

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user what they're working on (deck, memo, diligence prep) → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Overview
If a skill exists for what you're doing, **use it**. Read the relevant SKILL.md and follow the steps verbatim.

## When to Use
- You’re structuring a deck or memo.
- You’re answering investor questions or preparing diligence.
- You need a checklist for a specific topic (pricing, unit economics, TAM, GTM, etc.).

## Quick Workflow
1. Identify your task (e.g., “TAM for municipal BESS”).
2. Search the skills folder for keywords.
3. Read the SKILL.md; copy its checklists into a working doc.
4. Capture answers + sources; produce artifacts listed by the skill.
5. Before calling it “done,” run the skill’s **Common Mistakes** checklist.

## Artifacts
- A single planning doc with every relevant skill’s checklists answered.
- Links/tables requested by the skill (KPIs, price ladders, comps, etc.).

## Common Mistakes
- Skipping skills you *think* you already know.
- Answering qualitatively without evidence or numbers.
- Failing to create the required artifacts.
