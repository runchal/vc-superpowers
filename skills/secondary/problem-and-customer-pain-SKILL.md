# Problem & Customer Pain

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for customer pain/ICP data → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Core Questions
- Who is the **economic buyer**? Who are users, who blocks?
- What's the current workaround? Quantify pain (time, $$, risk, compliance).
- Trigger events? Frequency/seasonality? Procurement route?
- What KPI improves and by how much? How soon after go‑live?

## Quick Reference
- ICP (ideal customer profile): industry, size, geography, stack, triggers.
- Pain math: baseline → after → delta (%/$$) with sources.

## Artifacts
- One‑slide ICP + pain math; 3 customer quotes/logs; proof screenshot/log.

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing user pain with buyer pain.
- Treating "it's greener" as sufficient budget rationale.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/problem-and-pain-[segment].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Problem & Customer Pain: [Segment Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Input Data
[Paste of user's ICP/pain data from context.md]

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Industry** | [Industry/vertical] |
| **Company size** | [# employees or revenue range] |
| **Geography** | [Regions/countries] |
| **Tech stack** | [Key technologies they use] |
| **Trigger events** | [What causes them to buy] |
| **Job titles** | [Who we talk to] |

## Buyer/User/Blocker Map

**Economic buyer** (who signs the PO):
- **Title**: [e.g., VP Operations]
- **Pain they feel**: [What keeps them up at night]
- **Budget they control**: $[amount] or [budget category]

**Users** (day-to-day):
- **Title**: [e.g., Field Technicians]
- **Pain they feel**: [What makes their job harder]
- **What they care about**: [Productivity, ease of use, etc.]

**Blockers** (who can kill the deal):
- **Title**: [e.g., IT Security, Procurement]
- **Concerns**: [What they're worried about]
- **Mitigation**: [How we address their concerns]

## Pain Quantification

### Current Workaround
[Describe how customers solve this problem today]

### Pain Math (Baseline → After → Delta)

| Metric | Baseline (Before) | After (With Us) | Delta | Source |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| **Time** | [X] hrs/week | [Y] hrs/week | -[Z]% | [Interview, log data] |
| **Cost** | $[X]/year | $[Y]/year | -$[Z] | [Customer quote] |
| **Risk** | [X] incidents/year | [Y] incidents/year | -[Z]% | [Proof screenshot] |
| **Compliance** | [X] violations | [Y] violations | -[Z]% | [Log data] |

### KPI Improvement
**Primary KPI**: [Name of KPI, e.g., truck roll reduction]
**Improvement**: [X]% ([from baseline] → [after])
**Time to value**: [X] weeks/months after go-live

## Trigger Events & Procurement

**Trigger events** (what causes them to buy):
1. [Trigger 1, e.g., "New facility opening"]
2. [Trigger 2, e.g., "Grant funding approved"]
3. [Trigger 3, e.g., "Compliance deadline"]

**Frequency/seasonality**:
- [e.g., "Q4 budget cycles"]
- [e.g., "Post-grant award (6-12 month lag)"]

**Procurement route**:
- [e.g., "Direct buy (<$50K)"]
- [e.g., "RFP process (>$50K)"]
- [e.g., "Grant-funded (requires sole-source justification)"]

## Customer Evidence

### Quote 1
> "[Verbatim customer quote about pain]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

### Quote 2
> "[Verbatim customer quote about pain]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

### Quote 3
> "[Verbatim customer quote about pain]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

## Proof Artifacts
- [Screenshot/log 1]: [Description]
- [Screenshot/log 2]: [Description]
- [Screenshot/log 3]: [Description]

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes Check
- [ ] User pain vs buyer pain clearly separated
- [ ] Pain quantified with $$ or time, not just "it's better"
- [ ] Budget rationale beyond "it's greener"
- [ ] Trigger events identified (not just "they want it")
```
