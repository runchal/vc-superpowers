# Growth Motion & Sales Design

**Acronyms:** PLG (product‑led growth), SLG (sales‑led growth), ELG (enterprise‑led growth; top‑down with exec sponsors).

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for GTM motion/sales design data (ICP, ACV, current motion, early wins) → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Core Questions
- Motion: Why this ICP + ACV → this motion? Evidence from early wins?
- Channel: Direct vs VARs vs installers vs integrators; margin structure?
- Sales model: quota, cycle length, demo→pilot→PO conversion math.
- Post‑sale: onboarding, CS (customer success), SLAs, renewals.

## Quick Reference
- Pipeline math: top‑of‑funnel, stage rates, cycle time; show a **capacity plan**.

## Artifacts
- Process diagram; stage conversion table; hiring plan by quarter.

## Common Mistakes
- Forcing PLG into regulated or capex‑heavy buyers.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/growth-motion-and-sales-[company].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Growth Motion & Sales Design: [Company Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Input Data
[Paste of user's GTM motion/sales design data from context.md]

## Motion Selection

### ICP + ACV Analysis

| ICP Segment | ACV Range | Complexity | Decision Maker | Recommended Motion |
|-------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| [Segment 1] | $[X]-[Y]K | [Low/Med/High] | [Title] | [PLG/SLG/ELG] |
| [Segment 2] | $[X]-[Y]K | [Low/Med/High] | [Title] | [PLG/SLG/ELG] |
| [Segment 3] | $[X]-[Y]K | [Low/Med/High] | [Title] | [PLG/SLG/ELG] |

### Primary Motion: [PLG / SLG / ELG]

**Rationale** (why this ICP + ACV → this motion):
- [Reason 1 based on buyer behavior]
- [Reason 2 based on product complexity]
- [Reason 3 based on procurement process]

**Evidence from early wins**:
1. **[Customer name]**: [How they bought, cycle time, what worked]
2. **[Customer name]**: [How they bought, cycle time, what worked]
3. **[Customer name]**: [How they bought, cycle time, what worked]

## Channel Strategy

### Channel Mix

| Channel | Type | Margin Structure | Why This Channel | Readiness |
|---------|------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| [e.g., Direct] | [Direct/Indirect] | [% to us / % to partner] | [Rationale] | [Ready/Building/Future] |
| [e.g., VARs] | [Direct/Indirect] | [% to us / % to partner] | [Rationale] | [Ready/Building/Future] |
| [e.g., Installers] | [Direct/Indirect] | [% to us / % to partner] | [Rationale] | [Ready/Building/Future] |
| [e.g., Integrators] | [Direct/Indirect] | [% to us / % to partner] | [Rationale] | [Ready/Building/Future] |

**Primary channel (70%+ of revenue)**: [Channel name]
**Secondary channel**: [Channel name]

### Channel Partner Requirements

**For [Primary Channel]**:
- **Certification/training**: [What's required]
- **Margin**: [%]%
- **Support model**: [Who handles what]
- **Lead flow**: [Who generates, who qualifies]
- **Time to onboard partner**: [X] weeks

## Sales Model

### Team Structure

| Role | Quota | Cycle Length | Deals/Year | Comp Plan |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| **AE (Account Executive)** | $[X]K | [X] months | [Y] deals | $[base] + [commission %] |
| **SDR (Sales Dev Rep)** | [X] qualified leads | N/A | N/A | $[base] + [bonus] |
| **CSM (Customer Success)** | [X] accounts, [Y]% NRR | N/A | N/A | $[base] + [NRR bonus] |

### Funnel Math

| Stage | Count | Conversion % | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Top-of-funnel (leads)** | [X]/month | 100% | [Source: inbound, outbound, partners] |
| **Qualified (SQLs)** | [Y]/month | [%]% | [Qualification criteria] |
| **Demo/Discovery** | [Z]/month | [%]% | [What qualifies for demo] |
| **Pilot/POC** | [A]/month | [%]% | [Pilot terms, duration] |
| **Proposal** | [B]/month | [%]% | [Contract stage] |
| **Closed-Won** | [C]/month | [%]% | [Average deal size: $X] |

**Demo → Pilot → PO conversion**: [%]% overall
**Average cycle time**: [X] days/months (from first touch to signed PO)

### Capacity Plan (Next 8 Quarters)

| Quarter | AEs | SDRs | CSMs | Expected ARR | Notes |
|---------|-----|------|------|--------------|-------|
| Q1 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q2 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q3 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q4 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q5 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q6 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q7 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |
| Q8 | [#] | [#] | [#] | $[X]K | [Ramp notes] |

**Ramp assumptions**:
- **AE ramp**: [X] months to full productivity
- **SDR ramp**: [X] weeks to full productivity
- **CSM ramp**: [X] months to full book

## Post-Sale (Onboarding, CS, Renewals)

### Onboarding Process

**Timeline**: [X] weeks from signed PO to go-live

| Week | Milestone | Owner | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | [e.g., Kickoff call] | [Role] | [What "done" looks like] |
| 2-3 | [e.g., Installation] | [Role] | [What "done" looks like] |
| 4 | [e.g., Training] | [Role] | [What "done" looks like] |
| 5-6 | [e.g., Go-live] | [Role] | [What "done" looks like] |

### Customer Success (CS)

**CS model**: [High-touch / Tech-touch / Hybrid]
**Account coverage**: [# of accounts per CSM]
**SLA tiers**:
- **Enterprise**: [Response time, support level]
- **Standard**: [Response time, support level]
- **Basic**: [Response time, support level]

**Health score metrics**:
1. [Metric 1]: [Green/Yellow/Red thresholds]
2. [Metric 2]: [Green/Yellow/Red thresholds]
3. [Metric 3]: [Green/Yellow/Red thresholds]

### Renewals

**Renewal motion**: [Auto-renew / Manual / Hybrid]
**Renewal rate target**: [%]%
**Expansion drivers**: [What causes upsell/cross-sell]
**NRR target**: [%]%

## Sales Process Diagram

```
[Create a simple text-based flow diagram]

Lead → Qualify (SDR) → Demo (AE) → Pilot (AE + SE) → Proposal (AE) →
Contract (AE + Legal) → Onboarding (CS) → Renewals (CS)

Cycle time: [X] days total
```

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes Check
- [ ] PLG NOT forced into regulated or capex-heavy buyers
- [ ] Motion choice justified by ICP + ACV + early win evidence
- [ ] Pipeline math shows realistic conversion rates (not hockey stick)
- [ ] Capacity plan accounts for ramp time
- [ ] Channel partner requirements and margins defined
- [ ] Post-sale (onboarding, CS, renewals) planned, not just acquisition
```
