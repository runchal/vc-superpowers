# Fundraising Narrative & Arc

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for current deck/narrative status and key story elements → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Default Arc (10–12 slides)
1. Cold open (why now)  
2. Problem (pain math)  
3. Product (solution demo → outcomes)  
4. Proof (traction)  
5. Market (TAM/SAM/SOM)  
6. GTM (motion + pipeline math)  
7. Business model (pricing, unit econ)  
8. Moat (what compounds)  
9. Team (why you)  
10. Plan & Use of funds (milestones)  
11. Ask (round, instrument, status)  
12. Appendix (dive docs)

## Common Mistakes
- Starting with architecture diagrams; burying ask/use of funds.
- Overstuffing: 30 slides of facts, no story.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/fundraising-narrative-[round].md`

### Slide 2: Problem (Pain Math)
**Problem statement**: [Who feels what pain]
**Current workaround**: [What they do today]
**Pain quantification**: [Time/cost/risk in numbers]
**Quote**: "[Customer quote about the pain]" — [Name, Title, Company]

### Slide 5: Market (TAM/SAM/SOM)
**TAM**: $[X]M ([method: bottoms-up/tops-down/comps])
**SAM**: $[Y]M ([constraints applied])
**SOM (24mo)**: $[Z]M ([tied to capacity + channels])
**Source citations**: [Where numbers come from]

### Slide 6: GTM (Motion + Pipeline Math)
**ICP**: [Who we sell to]
**Motion**: [PLG/SLG/ELG + rationale]
**Channel**: [Direct/VARs/installers + margin structure]
**Pipeline math**: [Funnel stages, conversion rates, cycle time]
**Capacity plan**: [Sales hiring by quarter]
