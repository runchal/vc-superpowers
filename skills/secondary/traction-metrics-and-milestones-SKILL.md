# Traction, Metrics & Milestones

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for current traction metrics and forward milestones → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Core Questions
- What repeated thing is happening? (usage, revenue, retention, pilots→POs)
- KPI set by stage; cohort views; quality of revenue (concentration, gross margin).
- Forward plan: the 3 milestones that unlock the next round.

## Artifacts
- KPI table by stage; milestone gantt (quarterly) tied to hiring and cash.

## Common Mistakes
- Vanity metrics; logos without usage/expansion; milestones not tied to cash.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/traction-metrics-milestones-[company].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Traction, Metrics & Milestones: [Company Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## KPI Set by Stage

**Current stage**: [Pre-seed / Seed / Series A / Series B]

| Metric | Target (Current Stage) | Actual | Status |
|--------|------------------------|--------|--------|
| [KPI 1] | [Target] | [Actual] | [ ] On track [ ] Behind [ ] Ahead |
| [KPI 2] | [Target] | [Actual] | [ ] On track [ ] Behind [ ] Ahead |

## Quality of Revenue

### Revenue Concentration

| Customer | ARR | % of Total | Risk |
|----------|-----|------------|------|
| [Customer 1] | $[X] | [%]% | [Low/Med/High] |
| [Customer 2] | $[Y] | [%]% | [Low/Med/High] |
| [Customer 3] | $[Z] | [%]% | [Low/Med/High] |
| **Top 3** | **$[Total]** | **[%]%** | |
| All others | $[W] | [%]% | |

**Concentration risk**: [ ] Low (<50% in top 3) [ ] Medium (50-70% in top 3) [ ] High (>70% in top 3)

### Gross Margin by Customer/Segment

| Customer/Segment | Revenue | COGS | Gross Margin | Notes |
|------------------|---------|------|--------------|-------|
| [Customer 1] | $[X] | $[Y] | [%]% | [e.g., Custom install, higher COGS] |
| [Customer 2] | $[X] | $[Y] | [%]% | [e.g., Standard deployment] |
| [Segment A] | $[X] | $[Y] | [%]% | [e.g., Small business] |
| [Segment B] | $[X] | $[Y] | [%]% | [e.g., Enterprise] |

## Milestone Gantt (Quarterly View)

| Milestone | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Owner | KPI |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| [Milestone 1] | [Activity] | [Activity] | [Done] | | | | [Name] | [Metric] |

| [Milestone 3] | | [Activity] | [Activity] | [Activity] | [Activity] | [Done] | [Name] | [Metric] |

## Milestones Tied to Hiring and Cash

### Hiring Plan

| Quarter | Hires | Cost | Milestone Enabled |
|---------|-------|------|-------------------|
| Q1 | [e.g., VP Sales, 2 AEs] | $[X]K | [Milestone 1] |
| Q2 | [e.g., VP Eng, 3 engineers] | $[Y]K | [Milestone 2] |
| Q3 | [e.g., 2 CSMs] | $[Z]K | [Milestone 1] |
| Q4 | [e.g., VP Marketing] | $[A]K | [Milestone 3] |

### Cash Burn Tied to Milestones

| Quarter | Burn | Runway | Milestone Progress |
|---------|------|--------|--------------------|
| Q1 | $[X]K | [Y] months | [Milestone 1: 25% complete] |
| Q2 | $[X]K | [Y] months | [Milestone 1: 50% complete, Milestone 2: 25% complete] |
| Q3 | $[X]K | [Y] months | [Milestone 1: 75% complete, Milestone 2: 50% complete] |
| Q4 | $[X]K | [Y] months | [Milestone 1: 100% complete, Milestone 2: 75% complete] |

**Runway at Base burn**: [X] months (target: 18-24 months)

## Proof Story (Narrative)

**One-paragraph proof story** (for deck/pitch):
[In [time period], we've grown from [baseline] to [current state]. We've achieved [key metric 1], [key metric 2], and [key metric 3]. Our customers include [notable logo 1], [notable logo 2], and [notable logo 3], who've seen [outcome metric] improve by [%]%. This proves [insight about market/product fit]. Over the next [time period], we'll hit [milestone 1], [milestone 2], and [milestone 3], which will position us for [next round/goal].]

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes Check
- [ ] Metrics are NOT vanity metrics (tied to revenue/retention/usage)
- [ ] Logos shown WITH usage/expansion context (not just logo soup)
- [ ] Milestones tied to cash burn and runway
- [ ] Cohort view shows retention trends (not just point-in-time)
- [ ] Quality of revenue analyzed (concentration, gross margin)
- [ ] Forward milestones specific and unlock next round
