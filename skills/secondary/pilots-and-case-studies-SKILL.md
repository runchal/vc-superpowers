# Pilots & Case Studies

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for pilot/case study data (active pilots, success criteria, conversion triggers) → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Core Questions
- Success criteria in writing; who signs it; what happens on success?
- Data capture plan (usage, uptime, ROI); conversion triggers.
- Referenceability—logo use, quote, on‑site visit.

## Artifacts
- One‑page pilot SOW; case‑study template with before/after metrics.

## Common Mistakes
- Free pilots with no conversion trigger; no data capture.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/pilots-and-case-studies-[customer].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Pilots & Case Studies: [Customer Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Input Data
[Paste of user's pilot/case study data from context.md]

## Pilot Design

### Success Criteria (In Writing)

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Who Signs Off |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target value] | [How measured] | [Name, Title] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target value] | [How measured] | [Name, Title] |
| [Metric 3] | [Target value] | [How measured] | [Name, Title] |

**Success threshold**: [X] out of [Y] metrics must hit target

**Signed by**: [Name, Title, Date]

### Conversion Trigger

**What happens on success**:
- [ ] Automatic conversion to paid contract
- [ ] Pricing already agreed
- [ ] PO process pre-approved
- [ ] Budget allocated

**Pilot terms**:
- **Duration**: [X] weeks/months
- **Pricing**: [Free / $X pilot fee / Credits toward purchase]
- **Support level**: [SLA terms]
- **Exit clause**: [What happens if pilot fails]

### Data Capture Plan

**Usage metrics** (tracked automatically):
1. [Metric 1]: [How tracked, frequency]
2. [Metric 2]: [How tracked, frequency]
3. [Metric 3]: [How tracked, frequency]

**Uptime metrics**:
- **Target uptime**: [%]%
- **Monitoring method**: [How tracked]
- **Reporting frequency**: [Daily/weekly/monthly]

**ROI metrics** (tracked manually or via integration):
1. [Metric 1]: [Baseline, during pilot, delta]
2. [Metric 2]: [Baseline, during pilot, delta]
3. [Metric 3]: [Baseline, during pilot, delta]

**Data export plan**:
- **Weekly report**: [What's included, who receives]
- **Final report**: [Template, who signs off]

## Pilot SOW (Statement of Work)

```markdown
# Pilot SOW: [Customer Name]

**Pilot Duration**: [Start date] to [End date]

**Scope**:
- [What's included in the pilot]
- [What's excluded]
- [# of units/seats/sites]

**Success Criteria**:
1. [Metric 1]: Achieve [target]
2. [Metric 2]: Achieve [target]
3. [Metric 3]: Achieve [target]

**Responsibilities**:
- **[Company]**: [What we provide]
- **[Customer]**: [What they provide]

**Data Capture**:
- [What data we collect]
- [How we report it]
- [Who owns the data]

**Conversion Terms**:
- **On success**: [Pricing, contract terms, PO process]
- **On failure**: [Exit terms, equipment return, data deletion]

**Signatures**:
- [Our side]: _______________ Date: ___________
- [Customer side]: _______________ Date: ___________
```

## Case Study Template

### Before/After Metrics

| Metric | Before (Baseline) | After (With Us) | Delta | Measurement Period |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [% or $] | [X weeks/months] |
| [Metric 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [% or $] | [X weeks/months] |
| [Metric 3] | [Value] | [Value] | [% or $] | [X weeks/months] |

### Narrative Structure

**Customer Profile**:
- **Company**: [Name]
- **Industry**: [Industry/vertical]
- **Size**: [# employees, revenue range]
- **Challenge**: [One sentence: what problem they faced]

**The Challenge** (2-3 sentences):
[Describe the problem in the customer's words. Quantify the pain.]

**The Solution** (2-3 sentences):
[How we addressed it. What we deployed. Over what timeline.]

**The Results** (bullets):
- [Result 1 with number/percentage]
- [Result 2 with number/percentage]
- [Result 3 with number/percentage]

**Customer Quote**:
> "[Compelling quote about the outcome]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

### Referenceability

**Logo use**: [ ] Approved [ ] Not approved [ ] Pending
**Quote use**: [ ] Approved [ ] Not approved [ ] Pending
**On-site visit**: [ ] Approved [ ] Not approved [ ] Pending

**Reference terms**:
- [What customer agreed to]
- [Restrictions, if any]
- [Expiration date, if any]

## Pilot Conversion Tracking

**Pilot status**: [ ] Active [ ] Successful [ ] Failed [ ] Converted to paid

**Timeline**:
- **Pilot start**: [Date]
- **Pilot end**: [Date]
- **Decision date**: [Date]
- **Contract signed**: [Date] (if converted)

**Conversion details** (if successful):
- **Contract value**: $[X]
- **Contract term**: [X] months/years
- **Pricing**: [How they're billed]
- **Expansion potential**: $[Y] over [Z] years

**Lessons learned** (if failed):
- [What went wrong]
- [What we'd do differently]
- [What we learned about ICP/product/pricing]

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes Check
- [ ] Free pilots have clear conversion trigger
- [ ] Success criteria in writing and signed
- [ ] Data capture plan in place (not post-hoc)
- [ ] Referenceability terms agreed upfront
- [ ] Pilot SOW signed before deployment
