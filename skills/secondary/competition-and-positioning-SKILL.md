# Competition & Positioning

## Pre-work (MANDATORY)
1. Read `vc-work/context.md` to understand accumulated context
2. Ask user for competitive landscape data (competitors, alternatives, differentiators) → append to `context.md`
3. Log session start in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Core Questions
- Status quo + named vendors; who you replace vs complement.
- Feature vs **outcome** differentiation; proof from customer quotes.
- Switching friction (data, workflow, contracts, hardware).

## Artifacts
- 2x2 (for narrative) + tear‑down table (for diligence) with sources.

## Common Mistakes
- Cartoon quadrants without actual bake‑off evidence.

## MANDATORY Output

**Always create/update**: `vc-work/outputs/competition-and-positioning-[market].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Competition & Positioning: [Market/Category]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Input Data
[Paste of user's competitive landscape data from context.md]

## Competitive Landscape Map

### Status Quo
**What customers do today**: [Description of current solution/workaround]

### Named Competitors

| Competitor | Type | Replace/Complement | Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses |
|------------|------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| [Name 1] | [Direct/Indirect] | [Replace/Complement] | [Strengths] | [Weaknesses] |
| [Name 2] | [Direct/Indirect] | [Replace/Complement] | [Strengths] | [Weaknesses] |
| [Name 3] | [Direct/Indirect] | [Replace/Complement] | [Strengths] | [Weaknesses] |

## Differentiation Analysis

### Feature vs Outcome Differentiation

| Our Feature | Competitor's Feature | **Outcome Difference** | Proof Source |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| [Feature 1] | [Their version] | [Customer outcome we deliver] | [Quote/data] |
| [Feature 2] | [Their version] | [Customer outcome we deliver] | [Quote/data] |
| [Feature 3] | [Their version] | [Customer outcome we deliver] | [Quote/data] |

### Customer Evidence
> "[Quote showing why we won vs competitor X]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

> "[Quote showing outcome difference vs status quo]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

## Switching Friction Analysis

**From competitor to us**:
- **Data migration**: [Effort level, tools, timeline]
- **Workflow changes**: [What changes, training required]
- **Contracts**: [Typical contract length, exit clauses]
- **Hardware**: [Physical replacement cost/complexity]
- **Total switching cost**: $[amount] or [time estimate]

**From us to competitor**:
- **Data portability**: [How easy/hard]
- **Workflow lock-in**: [What keeps them with us]
- **Contract terms**: [Our lock-in mechanisms]
- **Hardware**: [Replacement/removal cost]
- **Total switching cost**: $[amount] or [time estimate]

## Positioning Map (2x2)

**Axes**: [X-axis label] vs [Y-axis label]

```
[Create a text-based 2x2 or describe positioning]

High [Y-axis]
    |
    |  [Competitor A]        [Us]
    |
    |  [Status Quo]   [Competitor B]
    |
Low |_________________________________
   Low              High [X-axis]
```

**Narrative**: [Why this positioning matters; what quadrant wins]

## Competitive Tear-Down Table (For Diligence)

| Dimension | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Status Quo | Source |
|-----------|----|--------------|--------------| -----------|--------|
| **Price** | $[X] | $[Y] | $[Z] | $[W] | [Source] |
| **Gross margin** | [%]% | [%]% | [%]% | N/A | [Source] |
| **Implementation time** | [X] weeks | [Y] weeks | [Z] weeks | [W] weeks | [Source] |
| **Key metric improvement** | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | Baseline | [Source] |
| **Support/warranty** | [Terms] | [Terms] | [Terms] | N/A | [Source] |
| **Certifications** | [List] | [List] | [List] | N/A | [Source] |

## Bake-Off Evidence

**Head-to-head wins**:
1. **[Customer name]**: Won vs [Competitor] because [reason] ([source: email, RFP, interview])
2. **[Customer name]**: Won vs [Competitor] because [reason] ([source: email, RFP, interview])
3. **[Customer name]**: Won vs [Competitor] because [reason] ([source: email, RFP, interview])

**Losses (and why)**:
1. **[Customer name]**: Lost to [Competitor] because [reason] ([lesson learned])
2. **[Customer name]**: Lost to [Competitor] because [reason] ([lesson learned])

## Red Flags / Common Mistakes Check
- [ ] 2x2 quadrants based on actual bake-off evidence, not assumptions
- [ ] Differentiation focuses on outcomes, not just features
- [ ] Customer quotes prove why we win
- [ ] Switching friction quantified (time/cost)
- [ ] Tear-down table includes sources for all claims
```

**End-of-session**: Log summary in `vc-work/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
